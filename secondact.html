<h1 style=color:khaki;>The Playlist</h1>
<br>
<br> 
<h2 style=color:cornflowerblue;> The story starts off with a man who works as a coder at a small sweden auction website. One day, he decided to create a website named Advertigo. 
    <br> Upon seeing a man named, Martin Lorentzon, he had requested for an appointment to sell his website named Advertigo for 10 million kronor. 
    <br> While having a chat with Martin, he brings up the topic of competing with Silicon Valley. 
    <br> Upon stumbling or finding the issues about Silicon Valley, Daniel Ek, had decided to create a new project. 
    <br> A faster, free, and legal site for music to be played called Spotify. 
    <br> He turned to Martin for assistance in completing the project. 
    <br> Facing many ups and downs with legalizing music issues, changing people's opinion, and accomplishing the set goals. 
    <br> He had finally found a chance to influence and let others know about his project to students who like listening to music.  </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 style=color:darkslateblue;> The characters in the first episode of the series were very interesting. Daniel Ek was a person who had a brilliant mind and could create new original ideas. 
    <br> Martin Lorentzon was a person who was a cheerful type of entrepreneur and open to business ideas once persuaded. 
    <br> Andreas Ehn was a person who looked responsible and a hard worker. 
    <br> The singer, Bobbie, seemed like a great singer and influence on the spotify project considering the fact that she is a singer whose gigs are illegally pirated in Silicon Valley. </h2>
    <br> 
    <br> 
<h2 style=color:lightsteelblue;> The series, “The Playlist”, connects with the hardship of most entrepreneurs having trouble having a chance on introducing their own projects and ideas. 
    <br> It is hard for small web developers to show their work due to other bigger web developers grabbing attention. 
    <br> Therefore, some lose faith or hope in showing their work to the world. 
    <br> As an entrepreneur the project they are working on must be catchy to people and profitable, which most of them have troubles with. 
    <br> There are various projects developers had created but were not profitable or catchy enough which would require them to exert more money to waste or work harder for people. 
    <br> It was saddening, knowing that most people who pursued business suffer from such loss and hard work. 
    <br> But in the end, the path they take will determine the future of their project. </h2>
